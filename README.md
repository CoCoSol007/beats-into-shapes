# Beats into Shape

**Beats into Shape** is our submission to [Youth Hacking 4 Freedom](https://fsfe.org/activities/yh4f/). We decided to craft a unique rhythm game where you forge items from the very beginning of the process.

## Gameplay

In **Beats into Shape**, you play as a smith in your forge, crafting objects in rhythm with the music. The game features 5 levels, each representing a crucial step in creating a flawless metallic object. Stay in sync with the beat to successfully forge your items and progress through the levels.

## Univers 
In a world where music and nature intertwine, there exists a hidden valley named Harmony. At the heart of this valley lies the Ethereal Forge, a place of creation where blacksmiths work in harmony with the natural rhythms of music. Eirik, a young blacksmith, inherits this forge and discovers the fulfilling craft of blacksmithing.

Play as the hero and learn step-by-step how to forge weapons in a chill, relaxed environment.
