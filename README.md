## Gameplay

In **Beats into Shape**, you play as a smith in your forge, crafting objects in rhythm with the music. The game features 4 levels, each representing a crucial step in creating a flawless metallic object. Stay in sync with the beat to successfully forge your items and progress through the levels.

## Universe

In a world where music and nature intertwine, there exists a hidden valley named Harmony. At the heart of this valley lies the Ethereal Forge, a place of creation where blacksmiths work in harmony with the natural rhythms of music. Eirik, a young blacksmith, inherits this forge and discovers the fulfilling craft of blacksmithing.

Play as the hero and learn step-by-step how to forge weapons in a chill, relaxed environment.

## Use Case

### Entertainment with Engaging Music

**Beats into Shape** aims to provide players with a unique and entertaining experience where they can immerse themselves in the rhythmic art of blacksmithing. By syncing their actions to the beat of captivating music, players can enjoy a relaxing yet engaging gameplay experience. The combination of crafting and rhythm challenges keeps the game interesting and enjoyable, ensuring players are both entertained and absorbed in the world of Harmony.

### Reusable and Generic Code

Our game is designed with a generic and reusable code structure that can be adapted for other rhythm-based games. This flexibility allows developers to easily modify and expand the game mechanics, integrate new musical elements, and create diverse rhythm-based experiences. The codebase is well-documented and modular, ensuring that future projects can leverage the foundational work done in **Beats into Shape** for innovative and exciting new rhythm games. You can find all documentation [here](/docs/beats_manager.md).
